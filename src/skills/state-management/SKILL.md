## Tool Fallback <!-- tool-fallback -->

- If a preferred tool, command, or skill is unavailable, failing, or a worse fit
  for the task, use the best available alternative rather than stopping or
  forcing it. Note which tool you used and why. Never fall back to a prohibited
  tool (for example `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` is banned — use `/browse`).

## Clarify Before Acting <!-- clarify-before-acting -->

Before running this skill or producing output, if the request is ambiguous or
the desired outcome is unclear, interview the user with focused questions until
intent is unambiguous. State assumptions and confirm them before proceeding.

- Keep state local unless it crosses a route or provider boundary.
- Use context only for cross-cutting state such as role.
- Keep wallet state in wagmi/Reown hooks.
- Avoid localStorage during server render.
- Prefer derived values over duplicated state.
