# TrustLedger

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/TrustLedger.png" alt="TrustLedger" width="120" />
</p>

A decentralized escrow and dispute resolution protocol for freelance agreements, deployed on Ethereum. Clients lock ETH or ERC-20 tokens; freelancers complete work; disputes are resolved by a staked juror panel using commit-reveal voting.

**Live app:** [trustledger-zeta.vercel.app](https://trustledger-zeta.vercel.app) - hosted on Vercel, deployed automatically on every push to `main`.

## Features

### On-Chain Proof of Agreement and Deliverable

When a contract is created, a `keccak256` hash of the off-chain agreement document and its IPFS URI are stored on-chain. When the freelancer submits work, a hash of the deliverable and its IPFS URI are stored the same way. Neither party can alter what was agreed to or what was delivered after the fact. Any tampering is immediately detectable by recomputing the hash.

### ECDSA Wallet Binding on Acceptance

The freelancer does not accept a contract by calling a function alone - they must submit an EIP-191 signature over `keccak256(contractId, freelancerAddress)`. The contract recovers the signer on-chain via `ecrecover` and rejects any mismatch. This prevents a third party from accepting a contract on a freelancer's behalf without their private-key authorization.

### Commit-Reveal Voting Prevents Herding

Jurors submit a `keccak256` commitment of their vote before anyone reveals. Votes are hidden during the commit phase so no juror can see the crowd forming and pile on. Only after the commit window closes do jurors reveal their actual numbers. Any deviation from the original commitment is rejected on-chain.

### Verifiable Random Juror Selection - Chainlink VRF

When Chainlink VRF is configured, jurors are selected at dispute-open time using on-chain verifiable randomness - not self-selection. Only pre-selected wallets can participate. When VRF is not configured, jurors self-select from the eligible pool (legacy mode). Both modes use the same commit-reveal flow.

### Partial Completion Rulings and Proportional Payouts

Jurors vote on a completion percentage (0-100), not a binary verdict. The median vote becomes the ruling. The payout formula is proportional: the freelancer's share scales with the ruling, and the arbitration fee burden is split proportionally between both parties - not charged entirely to the freelancer. This prevents winner-takes-all outcomes that neither party finds fair.

### Juror Slashing and On-Chain Reputation

Minority jurors - those whose votes fall more than 20 percentage points from the median - lose 10% of their staked ETH. Jurors who commit but never reveal are slashed the same way. Reputation decays with each minority vote and is tracked permanently on-chain. Jurors who vote accurately earn fee-pool rewards; careless or dishonest jurors lose money.

### Appeals with Escalating Panels

Either party can appeal a ruling within 72 hours by posting a 1.5× bond. The appeal opens a new dispute with double the juror panel (5 → 10 for the first appeal). Original jurors are explicitly blocked from the appeal panel so the second review is independent. If the appeal changes the ruling the bond is returned; if it confirms the original the bond is forfeited.

### Warranty Hold-Back

Clients can configure 5-15% of the payment to be withheld until a warranty period expires. If a defect surfaces after approval but within the warranty window, the client retains negotiating leverage. The hold-back is released to the freelancer automatically once the warranty deadline passes - no further action needed from either party.

### Automatic Release - Anti-Ghosting

After a freelancer submits proof of work, the client has a configurable acceptance window (minimum 48 hours) to approve or dispute. If the client does nothing, the freelancer can claim full payment once the window closes. Clients cannot indefinitely delay payment by simply not responding.

### ETH and ERC-20 Stablecoin Escrow

Escrow can be funded with native ETH or any ERC-20 token (e.g. USDC, DAI). Clients choose at creation time by specifying a token address; `address(0)` means ETH. All payout, hold-back, and dispute logic is token-aware. Stablecoin escrow eliminates price-volatility risk on long-duration agreements.

### Chainlink Price Feed - USD Value Lock

When a Chainlink ETH/USD feed is configured, the USD equivalent of the escrowed ETH is recorded on-chain at the moment of contract creation. Both parties can see - and later verify - the agreed dollar value regardless of subsequent ETH price moves.

### Bidirectional On-Chain Reputation

After a contract reaches a final state (approved or resolved), both parties can submit a rating score (1-100) for each other via `submitRating()`. Scores accumulate permanently on-chain in `ReputationRegistry`. Only `TrustLedger` can call `rate()` - third parties cannot manipulate scores.

### IPFS Hybrid Storage

Contract documents and proof-of-work artifacts are stored off-chain on IPFS. The smart contract holds only a 32-byte cryptographic hash and a URI pointer to each document. This keeps gas costs low while making any tampering immediately detectable.

### Permissionless Phase Transitions

Phase advances (`advanceToReveal`, `finalizeDispute`, `executeRuling`) are callable by anyone, not gated to a platform operator. The system progresses autonomously - no trusted admin is needed to move disputes forward or execute payouts.

## Architecture

### Contract Overview

| Contract                 | Role                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TrustLedger.sol`        | Core escrow engine. Manages the full lifecycle: create → accept → submit → approve/dispute. Holds funds and executes payouts. |
| `Arbitration.sol`        | Dispute resolution engine. Manages commit-reveal voting, juror slashing, appeals, and ruling execution.                       |
| `JurorRegistry.sol`      | Juror staking and eligibility. Tracks staked ETH, lock periods, active disputes, and slashing history.                        |
| `ReputationRegistry.sol` | On-chain reputation. Records bidirectional ratings (1-100) between clients and freelancers after each completed contract.     |

```text
TrustLedger  ←──────────────→  Arbitration  ←──→  JurorRegistry
  (escrow)      openDispute()    (disputes)          (jurors)
                executeRuling()
                                     ↕
                              ReputationRegistry
                           (rated via TrustLedger)
```

### Interfaces

<details>
<summary>Expand - all contract interfaces and their consumers</summary>

| Interface                   | Used By     | Purpose                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `IArbitration.sol`          | TrustLedger | `openDispute()` payable call                          |
| `ITrustLedger.sol`          | Arbitration | `executeRuling()` callback                            |
| `IJurorRegistry.sol`        | Arbitration | Lock/unlock/slash/eligibility                         |
| `IReputationRegistry.sol`   | TrustLedger | `rate()` after contract completion                    |
| `IERC20.sol`                | TrustLedger | `transfer()` / `transferFrom()` for stablecoin escrow |
| `AggregatorV3Interface.sol` | TrustLedger | `latestRoundData()` for ETH/USD price                 |
| `IVRFCoordinator.sol`       | Arbitration | `requestRandomWords()` for juror selection            |

</details>

### Optional One-Time Initializers

<details>
<summary>Expand - post-deploy optional integrations (immutable once set)</summary>

Three optional integrations are wired in after deployment via one-time setter functions. Once set they cannot be changed - there is no owner role.

| Function                          | Contract    | Effect                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `initPriceFeed(address)`          | TrustLedger | Enables Chainlink ETH/USD recording at creation |
| `initReputationRegistry(address)` | TrustLedger | Enables post-completion on-chain ratings        |
| `initVrfCoordinator(address)`     | Arbitration | Enables Chainlink VRF juror selection           |

</details>

### Deploy Order - Circular Dependency Resolution

All three contracts have cross-references. Both deploy scripts precompute the Arbitration address before deployment so no contract needs a mutable setter:

```text
nonce N   →  JurorRegistry  (initialized with precomputed Arbitration address)
nonce N+1 →  TrustLedger    (initialized with precomputed Arbitration address)
nonce N+2 →  Arbitration    (actual deploy - lands at the precomputed address)
```

### Contract Lifecycle

```text
PENDING  →  ACTIVE  →  SUBMITTED  →  APPROVED
                    ↘              ↗
                    DISPUTED  →  RESOLVED
↓
CANCELLED
```

| Status      | Meaning                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`   | Created; freelancer has not responded yet                         |
| `ACTIVE`    | Accepted; project deadline counting down                          |
| `SUBMITTED` | Proof of work submitted; acceptance window running                |
| `APPROVED`  | Client approved or acceptance window auto-elapsed                 |
| `DISPUTED`  | Dispute opened; in arbitration                                    |
| `RESOLVED`  | Ruling executed; funds distributed                                |
| `CANCELLED` | Freelancer rejected, client cancelled pending, or deadline missed |

### Payout Formula (Partial Rulings)

For a ruling of `pct`% on a contract with `amount` and `arbitrationFeeBps`:

```text
feePool          = amount × arbitrationFeeBps / 10000
rawPay           = (2 × pct × amount) / 300
freelancerFee    = feePool × pct / 100
freelancerPay    = rawPay − freelancerFee
clientRefund     = amount − feePool − freelancerPay
```

`0%` → full refund to client. `100%` → full payout to freelancer. Partial rulings scale proportionally with no threshold cliffs.

## Setup

> **Not sure where to start?**
>
> - **Just want to see a demo run?** → Skip to [Docker](#docker) - only Docker Desktop required, no other installs needed.
> - **Want to run scripts or deploy to testnet?** → Follow the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [Local Development](#local-development-hardhat-node) steps below.
> - **Want to use the live website?** → See [src/README.md](src/README.md) for the frontend setup.

---

### Prerequisites

You need three tools installed before anything else. Check if you already have them, then install any that are missing.

#### 1. Node.js (version 22 or later)

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime that powers Hardhat (the local blockchain) and all the deploy and test scripts. Without it, no `npm run ...` command will work.

**Check if you have it:**

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If `node --version` prints `v22.x.x` or higher, skip ahead. If it prints a lower version or `command not found`, install it:

- **macOS / Linux (recommended - use nvm so you can switch versions easily):**

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

    Close and reopen your terminal, then run:

    ```bash
    nvm install 22
    nvm use 22
    node --version   # should now print v22.x.x
    ```

- **Windows:** Download and run the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Select the version labeled **22.x.x LTS**.

- **Direct download (all platforms):** [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### 2. Foundry (forge, cast, anvil)

Foundry is the Solidity toolchain. It compiles contracts, runs the Solidity test suite, and ships `cast` - a command-line wallet utility used to generate deployer keys.

**Check if you have it:**

```bash
forge --version
```

If it prints a version number, you're good. Otherwise:

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This downloads the Foundry installer. After it finishes, close and reopen your terminal, then run:

```bash
foundryup
```

`foundryup` downloads the latest stable `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil` binaries. Verify with:

```bash
forge --version   # e.g. forge 0.3.x
cast --version
```

**Windows:** Foundry does not natively support Windows. Use [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the macOS/Linux steps inside the WSL terminal.

#### 3. Git

Git is required to clone the repository and fetch the smart contract library dependencies.

**Check if you have it:**

```bash
git --version
```

If it says `git version 2.x.x` you're good. Otherwise download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and run the installer.

---

### Clone the Repository

Open a terminal, navigate to wherever you keep your projects, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinle3212/TrustLedger.git
cd TrustLedger
```

Then pull in the smart contract library dependencies (OpenZeppelin and forge-std). These are stored as Git submodules - a way of pointing to another repo from inside this one:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> This is a one-time step. It downloads `contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` and `contracts/lib/forge-std/` which the Solidity compiler needs. If you skip it, `forge build` will fail.

---

### Install Node Dependencies

From the project root (the `TrustLedger/` folder you cloned into):

```bash
npm install
```

This reads `package.json` and downloads Hardhat, ethers.js, TypeScript, TypeChain, linters, and all other Node packages into a local `node_modules/` folder. Nothing is installed globally on your system. It takes about 30-60 seconds.

---

### Environment Variables

Your `.env` file holds private configuration (API keys, wallet private keys) that must never be uploaded to GitHub. The `.env.example` file is the safe public template showing which variables are needed.

**Step 1 - Copy the template:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp .env.example .env

# Windows Command Prompt
copy .env.example .env
```

**Step 2 - Open `.env` in a text editor** (VS Code, Notepad, TextEdit, etc.) and fill in the values you need. The subsections below walk through how to get each one.

| Variable                               | Required for            | Notes                                                                                     |

> `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` - Git will never include it in a commit. Only you can see it.

#### Getting an RPC URL (Alchemy or Infura)

An RPC URL is a web address that lets your scripts communicate with the Ethereum Sepolia network. You get one for free from either Alchemy or Infura.

**Alchemy (recommended):**

1. Sign up at [alchemy.com](https://www.alchemy.com/) - a Google or GitHub login works.
2. From the dashboard, click **+ Create new app**.
3. Set **Chain** to `Ethereum` and **Network** to `Ethereum Sepolia`. Name it anything.
4. Open the app you just created and click **API key** (top right). Copy the **HTTPS** URL.
   It looks like: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/abc123yourkey`
5. In your `.env` file, set:

    ```text
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/abc123yourkey
    ```

**Infura:**

1. Sign up at [infura.io](https://www.infura.io/).
2. Click **Create new API key** → choose **Web3 API** → name it.
3. Open the key, find the **Sepolia** endpoint, copy the HTTPS URL.
   It looks like: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/abc123yourkey`
4. In your `.env` file, set:

    ```text
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/abc123yourkey
    ```

#### Creating a Deployer Wallet

You need a wallet address and its private key to pay for and sign deployment transactions. **Always use a dedicated throwaway wallet - never your main MetaMask account with real ETH.**

**Option A - Generate one with `cast` (fastest):**

```bash
cast wallet new
```

Output looks like:

```text
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xAbCd1234...
Private key: 0xdeadbeef...
```

Copy both values into `.env`:

```text
DEPLOYER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=0xAbCd1234...
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xdeadbeef...
```

**Option B - Create a new account in MetaMask:**

1. Open MetaMask in your browser. Click the circular account icon at the top right.
2. Click **Add account or hardware wallet** → **Add a new Ethereum account**.
3. Give it a name like `TrustLedger Deploy` so you can identify it.
4. To get the private key: click the three-dot menu next to the account → **Account details** → **Show private key** → enter your MetaMask password → copy the key.
5. Copy the wallet address (shown at the top of MetaMask) and the private key into `.env`.

#### Getting Testnet ETH (Sepolia faucet)

Deploying to Sepolia costs a tiny amount of Sepolia ETH. Sepolia ETH is **free and has no real-world value** - it only works on the Sepolia test network.

1. Copy your deployer wallet address (the `0x…` string).
2. Paste it into any of these faucets and click **Send** / **Request**:
    - [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia) _(requires Alchemy account)_
    - [Infura Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) _(requires Infura account)_
    - [Google Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) _(requires Google account)_
3. Wait about 30 seconds. You need at least **0.05 ETH** to cover deployment gas.

Check your balance at any time:

```bash
npm run hardhat:check-balance
```

#### Getting an Etherscan API Key

Etherscan verification uploads your contract's source code to [sepolia.etherscan.io](https://sepolia.etherscan.io) so anyone can read and verify it. This is optional but strongly recommended for any public deployment.

1. Go to [etherscan.io/register](https://etherscan.io/register) and create a free account.
2. After logging in, click your username (top right) → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Add** → give it a name → click **Create New API Key**.
4. Copy the key and add it to `.env`:

    ```text
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=ABCDEF1234567890...
    ```

### Local Development (Hardhat Node)

Running locally spins up a fake Ethereum blockchain on your own computer - no real ETH, no internet required, and no risk of losing money.

You need **two terminal windows open at the same time**.

**Terminal 1 - Start the local chain and keep it running:**

```bash
npm run node
```

Hardhat starts a local blockchain at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and prints 20 pre-funded test accounts:

```text
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

Accounts
========
Account #0: 0x... (10000 ETH)
Private Key: 0x...
...
```

These are fake wallets with fake ETH. Leave this terminal open - closing it shuts down the chain.

**Terminal 2 - Compile the contracts and deploy them:**

```bash
npm run compile
```

This translates the Solidity `.sol` files into bytecode and generates TypeScript type definitions (TypeChain). Then deploy:

```bash
npm run hardhat:deploy:local
```

You should see output like:

```text
JurorRegistry deployed to: 0x...
TrustLedger   deployed to: 0x...
Arbitration   deployed to: 0x...
Deployed addresses written to artifacts/deployed-addresses.json
```

**Run the demo scripts (optional):**

```bash
# Happy path: client deposits ETH → freelancer accepts → submits work → client approves → payout
npm run demo:good

# Dispute path: client disputes → jurors vote → ruling executed → partial payout
npm run demo:bad
```

Both demos complete in seconds because they use time-travel (`evm_increaseTime`) to skip lock periods instantly.

---

### Ethereum Sepolia (Testnet)

Deploying to Sepolia puts the contracts on a public Ethereum test network that anyone can see and interact with. Requires a funded deployer wallet and an RPC endpoint - see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) above.

Make sure your `.env` has `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `DEPLOYER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS`, `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and at least 0.05 Sepolia ETH in the wallet, then run:

```bash
npm run hardhat:deploy:sepolia
```

The console prints all three contract addresses and writes them to `artifacts/deployed-addresses.json`. The frontend reads this file automatically - no manual copy step needed.

To also verify the source code on Etherscan (requires `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in `.env`):

```bash
npm run start:deploy:hardhat
```

---

### Docker

Docker lets you run demos and tests **without installing Node.js or Foundry**. Only Docker Desktop is required.

**Install Docker Desktop:** [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

After installing, verify:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

**One-time setup (do this once after cloning):**

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # fetch contract libraries if not done yet
docker compose build                       # build the image (~2-3 minutes first time)
```

**Run a demo or the test suite:**

```bash
docker compose up demo-good    # happy-path demo
docker compose up demo-bad     # dispute-flow demo
docker compose up node         # local chain only - connect MetaMask to http://localhost:8545
docker compose run test        # full Hardhat + Foundry test suite
```

**Dev container** (live-reloading, mounts your local files):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec dev bash   # open a shell inside
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml down            # tear down
```

See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for full Docker documentation including MetaMask connection and troubleshooting.

## How Hardhat and Foundry Are Used

TrustLedger uses both toolchains side by side. They share the same Solidity source files and
compiler settings (`solc 0.8.24`, `optimizer_runs = 200`, `via_ir = true`) but serve different
roles.

### Hardhat - integration layer

Hardhat is the TypeScript runtime for everything that crosses the contract boundary:

- **Local node** (`npm run node`) - an in-process EVM that mimics mainnet, used for manual
  interaction and demo scripts.
- **Deployment scripts** (`scripts/deploy.ts`) - ethers.js + TypeChain deploy all three contracts
  in the correct nonce order and write the resulting addresses to `artifacts/deployed-addresses.json`
  for frontend consumption.
- **Integration tests** (`test/TrustLedger.test.ts`, 146 tests) - multi-wallet flows written in
  TypeScript with full type safety. Tests cover ETH and ERC-20 escrow, Chainlink mock feeds, VRF
  mock, full dispute commit-reveal, appeals, and reputation. Balance diffs are verified at every
  payout step using ethers.js `BigInt` arithmetic.
- **TypeChain** - after every compile, TypeChain generates TypeScript classes for each contract so
  test code gets compile-time type checking on function signatures, arguments, and return values.

### Foundry - contract-native layer

Foundry runs entirely in Solidity, making it faster and more precise for low-level testing:

- **Unit tests** (`contracts/test/`, 65 tests) - Solidity-native tests using `vm.prank`,
  `vm.warp`, `vm.expectRevert`, and `vm.deal` cheatcodes. No JavaScript runtime overhead.
- **Fuzz tests** (`PayoutFuzz.t.sol`, 7 tests × 10,000 runs each) - property-based tests that
  prove payout invariants hold for the full `uint` input range. A single fuzz run covers more edge
  cases than hundreds of hand-written unit tests.
- **Gas reporting** (`npm run foundry:gas`) - per-function min/mean/max gas costs, used to catch
  regressions before deployment.
- **Deployment script** (`contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol`) - Forge script that precomputes contract
  addresses using the deployer's nonce, deploys all three contracts in order, and asserts the
  addresses match predictions. Run via `npm run foundry:deploy:sepolia`.
- **Formatter** (`forge fmt`) - enforces consistent Solidity style, configured in `foundry.toml`.

### Why both?

<details>
<summary>Expand - Hardhat vs. Foundry comparison</summary>

| Concern                  | Hardhat                                   | Foundry                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Multi-wallet integration | Native (ethers.js signers)                | Requires `vm.prank` workarounds    |
| TypeScript / frontend    | Native (TypeChain, wagmi-compatible ABIs) | No TypeScript support              |
| Test speed               | Slower (Node.js + JSON-RPC)               | Faster (native EVM, no IPC)        |
| Fuzz testing             | Requires external tools                   | Built-in, 10k runs per test        |
| Time travel              | `evm_increaseTime` via JSON-RPC           | `vm.warp` - inline, zero overhead  |
| Gas reports              | Plugin-based, less granular               | Per-function, built-in             |
| Solidity deployment      | JS script via ethers.js                   | Native Solidity (`forge script`)   |
| Testnet verification     | `hardhat verify` (Etherscan plugin)       | `forge script --verify` (built-in) |

## Testing

### Hardhat (Mocha/Chai) - Integration Tests

```bash
npm run hardhat:test
```

146 tests in `test/TrustLedger.test.ts`. Covers the full escrow lifecycle for ETH and ERC-20,
Chainlink price feed mock, VRF mock, full dispute flow with commit-reveal, appeals, and
ReputationRegistry. Uses TypeChain typed contract wrappers.

### Foundry (Forge) - Unit + Fuzz Tests

```bash
npm run foundry:test
# or with traces:
cd contracts && forge test -vvv
```

84 Foundry tests across five suites (the fork suite is skipped unless `FORK_URL` is set):

<details>
<summary>Expand - Foundry test suite breakdown</summary>

| Suite                    | Count | Type            | Covers                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TrustLedgerTest`        | 37    | Unit            | Full lifecycle, deadline, warranty, dispute, ruling payouts, reverts      |
| `JurorRegistryTest`      | 29    | Unit            | Register, stake lock, slash, eligibility, active dispute guard            |
| `ReputationRegistryTest` | 11    | Unit            | Constructor, `rate()` access control, score bounds, accumulation          |
| `PayoutFuzz`             | 7     | Fuzz (10k runs) | Payout conservation, formula correctness, buffer factor, hold-back bounds |
| `FullLifecycleFork`      | 4     | Fork            | End-to-end lifecycle against forked state (skipped without `FORK_URL`)    |

</details>

Foundry config (`contracts/foundry.toml`):

- Fuzz: 10,000 random inputs per fuzz test
- Invariant: 256 runs × 500 call depth
- IR pipeline (`via_ir = true`) - handles complex functions without stack-too-deep errors

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run all linters
npm run lint

# Solidity formatter
cd contracts && forge fmt --check    # CI check
cd contracts && forge fmt            # auto-fix

# TypeScript formatter
npm run lint:prettier                # check
npx prettier --write .               # auto-fix
```

TypeScript ESLint uses the `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` presets from `typescript-eslint`. Type-aware rules apply across both `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.hardhat.json`.

### TypeScript Configuration

<details>
<summary>Expand - tsconfig files and their roles</summary>

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `tsconfig.json`         | Root project (type-aware ESLint - `src/**` excluded) | NodeNext ESM                   |
| `tsconfig.hardhat.json` | `hardhat.config.ts`, `scripts/`, `test/`             | CommonJS (Hardhat requirement) |
| `src/tsconfig.json`     | Next.js frontend (`src/`)                            | ESNext, bundler resolution     |

The root and Hardhat configs extend `@tsconfig/strictest` with additional flags (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`). The frontend config uses its own strict settings compatible with Next.js and bundler resolution.

## Usage

### For the Backend Developer

The backend is responsible for the parts of the application flow that happen off-chain:

#### IPFS uploads before on-chain calls

Before calling `createContract()`, upload the agreement document to IPFS and pass the resulting CID as `contractURI`. Before calling `submitProofOfWork()`, upload the deliverable and pass the CID as `proofOfWorkURI`. The Solidity contract stores the CID and a `keccak256` hash of the file - the backend must hash the file before upload and pass both values.

#### Magic-link freelancer onboarding

The client submits the contract via the website and a signed magic link is emailed to the freelancer. The backend generates a single-use JWT containing the `contractId`, emails it to the freelancer's address, and the frontend uses the link to pre-fill the `acceptContract()` call. The on-chain acceptance requires a pre-computed ECDSA signature:

```ts
const inner = ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(
	["uint256", "address"],
	[contractId, freelancerAddress],
);
const sig = ethers.Signature.from(await wallet.signMessage(ethers.getBytes(inner)));
// Call: trustLedger.acceptContract(contractId, sig.v, sig.r, sig.s)
```

#### Deadline notifications

Subscribe to `ContractCreated` and `ContractAccepted` events. For each active contract, compare `projectDeadline` (stored in the `EscrowContract` struct via `getContract(id)`) against the current block time. Send deadline warnings starting 5 days out in 24-hour increments.

#### Event indexing

Use an Ethereum JSON-RPC node (Alchemy, Infura) or a dedicated indexer (The Graph) to subscribe to all contract events. Store indexed data in SQL for fast frontend queries without repeated on-chain reads. Key tables: contracts, disputes, jurors, ratings.

### Demo Scripts

Two scripts illustrate the full lifecycle against a running local node:

```bash
# Option A - two terminals
npm run node                   # terminal 1 (keep open)
npm run compile
npm run hardhat:deploy:local   # terminal 2

# Option B - single command (starts node in background)
npm run start:deploy:local

# Happy path - client approves, freelancer receives full 1 ETH
npm run demo:good

# Dispute flow - jurors vote 50%, freelancer receives ~0.258 ETH
npm run demo:bad
```

## Why Hardhat 2.x, Not 3.x

This project pins `hardhat@^2.x` intentionally. Hardhat 3.x was evaluated and reverted:

<details>
<summary>Expand - Hardhat 2.x vs. 3.x comparison</summary>

| Concern              | Hardhat 2.x                                                                 | Hardhat 3.x (alpha)                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TypeChain**        | Stable first-class plugin                                                   | No stable TypeChain plugin - 3.x overhauled the plugin API |
| **Toolbox**          | `hardhat-toolbox@5` bundles TypeChain + ethers v6 + gas reporter + coverage | 3.x toolbox is separate, incomplete, and still evolving    |
| **ESM/CJS**          | Works with `"module": "CommonJS"` + ts-node CJS override for Node.js 22+    | Defaults to ESM, which breaks the ts-node CJS workaround   |
| **Plugin ecosystem** | `hardhat-gas-reporter`, `solidity-coverage`, Slither all verified           | Several plugins lack 3.x-compatible releases               |
| **Stability**        | Mature, semver-stable                                                       | Alpha - breaking changes between releases disrupt CI       |

</details>

Upgrade once Hardhat 3.x reaches a stable release and TypeChain publishes a compatible plugin.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

Five workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. All use least-privilege tokens and concurrency groups to cancel stale runs on new commits.

### `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration

Runs on every push and pull request to `main`.

<details>
<summary>Expand - CI job breakdown</summary>

| Job            | What it does                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | `npm ci` (in `src/`), TypeScript typecheck, ESLint + Prettier, `next build`                       |
| **TypeScript** | `npm ci`, `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint + Solhint, Prettier format check                                 |
| **Solidity**   | Foundry install, `forge fmt --check`, `forge build --sizes`, `forge test -vvv`, gas snapshot diff |

The Solidity job sets `working-directory: contracts` so all `forge` commands run from the directory containing `foundry.toml`. The Frontend job sets `working-directory: src` and uses `src/package-lock.json` for npm cache keying.

</details>

### `deploy.yml` - Manual Deploy to Ethereum Sepolia

Triggered only via **Actions → Run workflow** - never auto-deploys on push.

<details>
<summary>Expand - required secrets</summary>

Requires a GitHub Environment named `ethereum-sepolia` with three secrets:

| Secret                 | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`      | RPC endpoint (Alchemy or Infura)               |
| `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Funded deployer wallet private key             |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`    | Etherscan API key (only needed when verifying) |

</details>

Broadcast artifacts (contract addresses, transaction receipts) are uploaded as a workflow artifact and retained for 30 days.

### `github-models.yml` - GitHub Models prompt tests

Runs on changes to `.github/prompts/`, `scripts/models/`, or [docs/GITHUB_MODELS.md](docs/GITHUB_MODELS.md). Uses `actions/ai-inference` and optional `gh models eval` on each `.prompt.yml`, plus the Python examples in `scripts/models/github_models_example.py`. See [docs/GITHUB_MODELS.md](docs/GITHUB_MODELS.md).

### `security.yml` - Security Scans

Runs on push/PR to `main`, manually via `workflow_dispatch`, and weekly (Mondays 13:00 UTC) to catch CVEs in transitive deps even when no code changes.

<details>
<summary>Expand - security scan jobs</summary>

| Job                    | Tool                         | Catches                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slither**            | `crytic/slither-action`      | Solidity SAST: reentrancy, uninitialized storage, dangerous low-level calls. Results appear as inline PR comments via SARIF upload to the Security tab. |
| **TruffleHog**         | `trufflesecurity/trufflehog` | Secret scanning across full git history - accidental commits of `.env` values or private keys.                                                          |

### `frontend-deploy.yml` - Vercel Deploy

Triggers on push to `main` when files under `src/**`, `artifacts/deployed-addresses.json`, or the workflow file itself change. Also supports manual `workflow_dispatch`.

<details>
<summary>Expand - deploy steps and required secrets</summary>

| Step   | What it does                                                                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pull   | `vercel pull --environment=production` - syncs project settings and env vars from Vercel |
| Build  | `vercel build --prod` - builds the Next.js app using Vercel's build pipeline             |
| Deploy | `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod` - uploads the prebuilt output to Vercel's edge network |

Requires three repository secrets: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for setup instructions.

### `dependabot-automerge.yml` - Dependabot Auto-Merge

<details>
<summary>Expand - auto-merge rules</summary>

| Condition                                                  | Action                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| PR has one or more GHSA IDs (security advisory)            | Auto-merge via squash, any semver level |
| Patch bump of a dev-only dependency (no security advisory) | Auto-merge via squash                   |
| Everything else (minor/major, prod deps)                   | Requires manual review                  |

</details>

`--auto` queues the merge and executes only after all required branch protection checks pass. Enable **auto-merge** in repository Settings → General and configure required status checks in Settings → Branches.

## Code Review and Git Commit Best Practices

### CodeRabbit

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) performs automated AI code review on every pull request. Configuration lives in `.coderabbit.yaml` at the repo root.

<details>
<summary>Expand - CodeRabbit review paths and focus areas</summary>

| Path                        | Review focus                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contracts/src/**/*.sol`    | Reentrancy, access control, pull-over-push pattern, event emissions, unchecked arithmetic |
| `contracts/test/**/*.sol`   | Revert coverage, fuzz tests for unbounded inputs, no hardcoded addresses                  |
| `contracts/script/**/*.sol` | No hardcoded secrets, correct `vm.startBroadcast` scope                                   |
| `**/*.ts`                   | No `any`, missing `await`, unhandled rejections, no hardcoded keys                        |
| `hardhat.config.ts`         | Consistent compiler version and optimizer settings with `foundry.toml`                    |
| `.github/workflows/**`      | Pinned action versions, secrets via `secrets.*` only, least-privilege permissions         |

### Git Commit Guidelines

Commit messages are enforced automatically by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) via a `commit-msg` git hook. A non-conforming message will be rejected at commit time with a clear error. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
feat: add claimWarrantyFunds to release hold-back after warranty period
fix: prevent double-release when acceptanceDeadline and warrantyDeadline coincide
test: add fuzz coverage for partial ruling payout conservation
chore: bump hardhat to 2.28.6
docs: update README with frontend integration guide
lint: fix Solhint max-line-length warning in JurorRegistry
```

<details>
<summary>Expand - commit type reference</summary>

| Type       | When to use                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or function                         |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                         |
| `test`     | Add or update tests                             |
| `chore`    | Dependency bumps, config changes, build tooling |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                              |
| `lint`     | Linting or formatting fixes                     |
| `refactor` | Code restructured without behavior change       |

</details>

Keep the subject line under 72 characters. Reference issue numbers in the body when applicable. Do not include AI tool attribution footers.

To test commitlint without making a real commit:

```bash
# Should pass silently
echo "feat: add escrow timeout mechanism" | npx commitlint

# Should fail with type-empty and subject-empty errors
echo "wip" | npx commitlint

# Test the commit-msg hook directly on a temp file
echo "bad message" > /tmp/test-commit-msg && \
  npx commitlint --edit /tmp/test-commit-msg
```

## Testnet vs. Local - Do You Need Faucet Funds?

No. All local development, demos, and tests run entirely on the Hardhat node inside the container. Hardhat pre-funds all 20 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each - no external faucet is needed.

Faucet ETH (Ethereum Sepolia) is only required when you deploy to the public testnet:

```bash
# Requires SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY in .env
npm run hardhat:deploy:sepolia
```

For testnet faucet ETH: use a Sepolia ETH faucet (Alchemy, Infura, or Google).

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full vulnerability reporting policy, in-scope contracts, severity classification, and response timeline.

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.** Report privately via the contact in `SECURITY.md`.

TrustLedger is currently pre-mainnet. No contracts hold real user funds. The codebase targets Ethereum Sepolia (testnet) and is under active development.
